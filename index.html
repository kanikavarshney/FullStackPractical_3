    <h1>Welcome to FullStack Course</h1>
    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Full-stack refers to a group of programming languages and tools a developer 
        learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development of a website.
         MEAN stack, on the other hand, is a popular full-stack framework, which 
         consists of MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and NodeJS. 
    </p>
    <p>Full-stack isn’t necessarily restricted to a particular set of languages,
        while frameworks like MEAN stack is. As a full-stack developer, you’ll 
        have to learn multiple languages related to web development along with
        a few concepts of web design. Full-stack mainly refers to the developer,
        whereas MEAN stack is an acronym for a full-stack framework. Both of them
        are widely popular. And the demand for full stack developers  is very high.
        However, there are a lot of areas where these two differ, apart from the ones
        we’ve discussed already.
